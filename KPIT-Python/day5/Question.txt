Design a system to monitor environmental conditions using different types of sensors.

Base Class: Sensor
• Attributes: 
o sensor_id (string)
o location (string)
o reading (float)
o unit (string)
o alerts (list of strings): e.g., ["Low Battery", "Signal Lost"]
o metadata (dict): e.g.{"manufacturer": "ABC Corp", "model": "X100", "warranty_years": 2}
• Methods: 
o Initialize attributes.
o Getters and setters.
o __repr__() for readable representation.
o status_message(): Default message: "Sensor operational" (to be overridden).

Derived Class 1: TemperatureSensor
• Additional Attributes: 
o historical_readings (list of floats): e.g., [22.5, 23.0, 21.8]
o calibration_values (dict): e.g.{"offset": 0.5, "scale": 1.02}
• Methods: 
o Override status_message(): "Temperature Sensor: Normal" if reading between 15°C and 35°C else "Temperature Sensor: Alert".
o average_temperature(): Compute average from historical_readings.
o apply_calibration(): Adjust reading using calibration_values.

Derived Class 2: HumiditySensor
• Additional Attributes: 
o sensor_age_years (int)
o maintenance_log (list of strings): e.g., ["Filter replaced", "Firmware updated"]
o performance_metrics (dict): e.g.{"accuracy": 98.5, "response_time_ms": 120}
• Methods: 
o Override status_message(): "Humidity Sensor: Optimal" if reading between 30% and 60% else "Humidity Sensor: Alert".
o predict_remaining_life(): Remaining life = max(0, 10 - sensor_age_years).
o last_maintenance(): Return last entry from maintenance_log.

Create Objects
• Create at least 3 TemperatureSensor objects and 2 HumiditySensor objects.
• Store all objects in a single list called sensors.

Function 1: filter_sensors_with_alerts(sensors)
• Input: sensors (list of Sensor objects)
• Task: Return all sensors that have at least one alert.
• Output: List of Sensor objects with non-empty alerts.

Function 2: sort_sensors_by_reading(sensors)
• Input: sensors (list of Sensor objects)
• Task: Sort sensors in ascending order of their reading.
• Output: Sorted list of Sensor objects.

Function 3: extract_sensor_ids(sensors)
• Input: sensors (list of Sensor objects)
• Task: Extract all sensor IDs into a list.
• Output: List of strings (sensor IDs).

Function 4: compute_average_reading(sensors)
• Input: sensors (list of Sensor objects)
• Task: Compute the average of all sensor readings.
• Output: Float (average reading).

Function 5: add_alert_to_sensor(sensor, alert)
• Input: 
o sensor → A single Sensor object (or derived class object).
o alert → String representing the alert message (e.g., "Low Battery").
• Task: 
o Add the given alert to the sensor’s alerts list only if it is not already present.
• Output: 
o Updated Sensor object with the new alert added.
• Constraints: 
o Must handle: 
 Duplicate prevention.
 Empty alert string (ignore if blank).

Function 6: display_all_sensors
• Name: display_all_sensors(sensors)
• Input: 
o sensors → List of Sensor objects (including derived classes).
• Task: 
o Print details of each sensor in the list 
o Include sensor type (TemperatureSensor or HumiditySensor).
• Output: 
o Printed representation of all sensor objects.
