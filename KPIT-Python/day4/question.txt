Create two classes:
Battery → Represents individual battery cells with 5 attributes (including Enums).
BatteryManagementSystem → Manages a dictionary of Battery objects and performs operations using lambda and comprehensions.
 
-Enums to Use
BatteryType → LI_ION, NIMH, LEAD_ACID, SOLID_STATE
BatteryStatus → CHARGING, DISCHARGING, IDLE, FAULT
 
-Battery Class
Attributes:
battery_id → Unique identifier for the battery.
battery_type → Enum BatteryType.
status → Enum BatteryStatus.
voltage → Current voltage of the battery.
temperature → Current temperature of the battery.
 
BatteryManagementSystem Class
Attributes:
batteries → Dictionary where key = battery_id, value = Battery object.
max_voltage_limit, min_voltage_limit, max_temp_limit → Safety thresholds.
alerts → List of alerts generated.
 
Functionalities (using lambda & comprehensions)
Add a new Battery object to dictionary
      → Validate Enums and store in batteries.
Remove a Battery by ID
Update Battery status:→ Change Enum status dynamically.
Monitoring & Calculation
Calculate total voltage of all batteries.
Calculate average temperature.
Find battery with max voltage
Find battery with min temperature.
Filter batteries above max temperature
Filter batteries below min voltage.
Generate alerts for abnormal conditions:→ Use lambda to check and append alerts.
Create summary dictionary of battery voltages.
Create list of battery types.
Sort batteries by voltage
Sort batteries by temperature descending
Count batteries by status
Predict charging completion time:→ Lambda based on voltage difference and charging rate.
Generate historical voltage trend:→ Extract voltages from logs using [h['voltage'] for h in history].
Check if all batteries are healthy (within limits)
